## Connect WiFi
To connect with WiFi, create a txt file named, creds.txt. Put the SSID on one line, and the password on another. Save, push to esp, and reboot.

ex:
something_SSID
something_password

Another option would be to connect by terimnal, and upon first boot up, it will prompt for a SSID, and password to save.
